# NetIndexStatisticalAnalysis
Modelling of Net Index data
The NetIndex is a collective data of internet speeds based on the OoklaTM Speedtest.net for a sufficiently long period which is large enough to draw some conclusions on general behaviour

Technologies Used
Programming Language: R
IDE: RStudio
Operating System: Windows, GNU/Linux
Data Processing: Bash shell

For the download speed we model it with cubic polynomial and got the following obeservations.

Similarly for the upload speed.

model it with quartic polynomial and got the following obeservations.
